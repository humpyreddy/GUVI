Javascript is an implementation of ECMAScript, a standard defining the programming language.
Browsers have a built-in interpreter for Javascript, along with a bunch of libraries and a run-time environment for working with web pages on the client-side. 
JS(Browser) has access to global object window.
JS(Browser) has access to document which stores a reference to the DOM, whenever we change the document, the changes are reflected in the DOM.

NodeJS was written in C++
Node JS provides a run-time environment outside the browser.
Chromes JavaScript engine is V8 which is also used by NodeJS.
NodeJS doesn't have access to window object, but has access to global which is similar to window.
NodeJS doesn't have access to document. It has access to process, which gives information about the current node process.
It also includes a package management system (NPM) and a few language extensions you won't find standard in browsers (for example modules).
