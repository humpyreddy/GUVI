HTTP 1.1 VS. HTTP 2.0

Why was HTTP 1.1 introduced?
•	The internet revolution was in its initial state.
•	HTTP 1.1 was introduced in 1997 as the internet ecosystem was growing with a rapid pace during that period of time. 
•	The internet landscape was changing constantly with new websites becoming more dynamin and heavy. As the resource usage increased; more features were required.
•	Keep Alive was introduced in this update to connect faster.
•	Keep Alive – option enables the reusing of the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP requests.w

What is wrong with HTTP 1.1?
•	The TCP connections between the Client and Server are limited. 
•	HTTP request is stateless and every request is independent of the previous request or subsequent request. As such, each request will carry its own data like user-agent, cookie, cache etc. in the request header. This header information is repeated with every request and at times it’s unnecessary and also the header couldn’t be compressed.
•	This would often slow down the connection.

HTTP 2.0 was introduced in 2015
•	Single Secure TCP connection is used in which single pipeline with streams that are used to create different http requests in a stream frame, which makes the connection swift and fast. 
•	With the stream prioritization feature of HTTP 2.0, it allows developers to customize the relative weight of the requests to better optimize the application performance.
•	HPACK allows for the header data to be separate from Request Data and can be zipped.
•	HPACK enables reusability of header data which is repeated in every request. 
•	It also reduces the size of the HTTP request.
