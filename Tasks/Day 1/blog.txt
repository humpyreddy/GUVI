The keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively, in the context of an object.
let employee = {
name : "Vivek",
location : "Delhi",
age : 30
}
In the above example "name", "location", "age" are all "keys" and "Vivek", "Delhi" and 30 are values of these keys respectively.
Each of these keys are referred to as "properties" of an object.
An object in JavaScript may also have a function as a member, in which case it will be known as a method of that object.
For example:
let employee = {
name: 'Vivek',
location : 'Delhi',
CTC : 1200000,
displayInfo : function(){
console.log(${employee.name} is working
 at ${employee.location} with the CTC ${employee});
}
}
employee.displayInfo();
In the above example, "displayinfo" is a method of the employee object that is being used to work with the object's data, stored in its properties.
